# Stock-Tracker-project
URL : https://donteventry143.github.io/Stock-Tracker/

A responsive website that allows users to track stock prices in real time. The platform highlights trending stocks and enables users to search for specific stock symbols, displaying their current prices, price changes, and percentage variations. This project demonstrates key web development concepts, including API integration, dynamic data rendering, and UI design.

Features :

Real-Time Stock Tracking: Fetch and display the latest stock prices and changes. Trending Stocks Section: Showcases a predefined list of trending stocks (e.g., Apple, Tesla, NVIDIA). Search Functionality: Allows users to search for any stock symbol and view its performance. Dynamic Data Rendering: Updates stock prices and trends dynamically using API data. Interactive UI: Modern and sleek design with hover effects and real-time updates.

Technologies Used :

HTML: Structuring the website content. CSS: Styling the layout with a modern dark theme and responsive grid designs. JavaScript: Adding interactivity, handling API calls, and dynamically updating the DOM. Finnhub API: Fetching real-time stock data.

Future implementations : 

In the future, I plan to implement a user sign-in system that allows individuals to create accounts and securely log in to the platform. This feature will enable users to track their own stock portfolios, monitor their holdings, and view performance metrics over time. Additionally, I will introduce a social feature where users can follow their friends to see what stocks they are holding. For privacy, friends' portfolios will be displayed anonymously, showing only percentage allocations (e.g., "30% in Apple, 20% in Tesla"), fostering collaboration and idea sharing among users.
